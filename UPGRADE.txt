on admin/build/modules disable the transactions module
if you have enabled the user_friendly form, go to your default currency and check the boxes to enable the exchange types
all views will be replaced
some blocks will be migrated
check all your theme customisations
Views will need reworking.
    Starter and Completer no longer exist, instead there is payer, payee, and signatories
    Relationships no longer needed
    Note that you can now filter by exchange_type

(optional, to be tidy, move the 3 files extensions/offer_want to their own module folder and replace the whole mutual_credit )
