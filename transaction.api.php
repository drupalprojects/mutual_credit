/**
 * @file
 * Formal description of transaction handling function and Entity controller functions
 *
 * N.B. transaction' can have 3 different meanings
 *  a database transaction (not relevant to this document)
 *  Fieldable entity with one or more '$items' each a in different currency. This is what views works with
 *  A transaction cluster is an array of the previous 'transactions',
 *  usually before they are written to the db, where they will have the same serial number and state
 *    The first transaction in a cluster 'volitional' and the rest, 'dependent',
 *   which means they were created automatically, from the volitional
 *   the dependent transactions share a serial number and state, but probably have a different 'type'
 *  When a transaction is loaded from the db, the dependents are put into (array)$transaction->dependents.
 *
 * Typical procedure for form processing might be
 * form validation
 *   //create the transaction object and save the extranneous fields
 *   //use drupal_alter to add any dependent transactions
 *   $transactions = array($transaction);
 *   drupal_alter('transactions', $transactions);
 *   transaction_cluster_write($transactions, FALSE)
 *     hook_transaction_validate
 *     EntityController->insert($transactions, FALSE)
 * end form validation
 * form submission
 *   //use drupal_alter to add any dependent transactions
 *   $transactions = array($transaction);
 *   drupal_alter('transactions', $transactions);
 *   transaction_cluster_write($transactions, TRUE);
 *     hook_transaction_validate
 *     EntityController->insert($transactions, TRUE)
 *     field_attach_insert('transaction', $transaction);
 *       hook_transaction_state
 * end form submission
 *
