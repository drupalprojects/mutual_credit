# THE POTX MODULE ONLY GETS STRINGS FROM FILES WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE MODULE, SO ALL THESE WERE EXCLUDED
# THIS FILE WAS OBTAINED BY RUNNING POTX FROM THE COMMAND LINE IN THIS DIRECTORY
# TO MAKE THESE STRINGS IMPORT AUTOMATICALLY, THEY SHOULD BE APPENDED TO THE TRANSACTIONS PO FILE
# FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPENDED TO THE TRANSACTIONS POT TEMPATE FILE
